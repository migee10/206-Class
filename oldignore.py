## SI 206 - HW
## COMMENT WITH: Michele Gee
## Your section day/time: 8:30 AM MLB Basement
## Any names of people you worked with on this assignment: Aaron Kyle Priscilla


## Write code that uses the tweepy library to search for tweets with three different phrases of the
## user's choice (should use the Python input function), and prints out the Tweet text and the
## created_at value (note that this will be in GMT time) of the first FIVE tweets with at least
## 1 blank line in between each of them, e.g.


## You should cache all of the data from this exercise in a file, and submit the cache file
## along with your assignment.

## So, for example, if you submit your assignment files, and you have already searched for tweets
## about "rock climbing", when we run your code, the code should use CACHED data, and should not
## need to make any new request to the Twitter API.  But if, for instance, you have never
## searched for "bicycles" before you submitted your final files, then if we enter "bicycles"
## when we run your code, it _should_ make a request to the Twitter API.

## Because it is dependent on user input, there are no unit tests for this -- we will
## run your assignments in a batch to grade them!

## We've provided some starter code below, like what is in the class tweepy examples.

## **** For extra credit, create another file called twitter_info.py that
## contains your consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, and access_token_secret,
## import that file here.  Do NOT add and commit that file to a public GitHub repository.

## **** If you choose not to do that, we strongly advise using authentication information
## for an 'extra' Twitter account you make just for this class, and not your personal
## account, because it's not ideal to share your authentication information for a real
## account that you use frequently.

## Get your secret values to authenticate to Twitter. You may replace each of these
## with variables rather than filling in the empty strings if you choose to do the secure way
## for EC points
